# Predicting Bike Rental Demand for Capital Bikeshare and Citi Bike Using Weather Conditions

## **Overview**
<p style="font-size:16px;">
Bike-sharing programs have gained popularity as a sustainable transportation option in urban areas, providing convenience and reducing environmental impact. This project focuses on understanding and predicting hourly bike rental demand for Capital Bikeshare (Washington D.C.) and Citi Bike (New York) using weather conditions. The study employs machine learning models, including LSTM and Simple RNN, to explore the relationship between weather patterns and bike usage, providing actionable insights for optimizing resource allocation and improving service availability.

## **Key Objectives**
### **1. Analyze the Impact of Weather**
<p style="font-size:16px;">Understand how variables like temperature, precipitation, humidity, solarradiation, dew and windspeed influence hourly bike rental demand.</p>

### **2. Comparative Analysis**
<p style="font-size:16px;">Identify differences in rental demand patterns between Capital Bikeshare and Citi Bike, focusing on geographic and climatic variations.</p>

### **3. Seasonal and Temporal Trends**
<p style="font-size:16px;">Investigate how bike usage varies by season and time of day to enhance prediction accuracy and operational efficiency.</p>

## **Methodology**
### **1. Data Sources**
<p style="font-size:16px;">
Bike Rental data: From Capital Bikeshare and Citi Bike companies websites  

  Weather data: Visual Crossing API
</p>

### **2. Models Used**
<p style="font-size:16px;">
  Traditional Models: Linear regression, KNN, SVR and Decision Trees
  
  Ensemble Models: Random Forest bagging, AdaBoost, XGBoost, GradientBoost and Stacking
  
  Sequential models: Simple RNN, LSTM and GRU
  Performance Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, RÂ²
</p>

### **3. Comparative Approach**
<p style="font-size:16px;">Cross-city analysis of Washington D.C. and New York to explore demand patterns influenced by weather.</p>

## **Implications**
<p style="font-size:16px;">
The findings will help bike-sharing companies to
  
Optimize Operations: Anticipate demand and allocate bikes efficiently.
  
Enhance User Experience: Ensure bike availability during peak usage times.  

Improve Sustainability: Reduce rebalancing costs and align with urban mobility goals.
</p>

## **Conclusion**
<p style="font-size:16px;">
This project combines data-driven techniques and weather analysis to predict bike rental demand in two major U.S. cities, providing actionable insights for sustainable urban transportation. The results can guide future research and operational strategies for bike-sharing systems.
